# Himanshu Raj - Personal Portfolio

This is my personal portfolio website, built with React, Vite, TypeScript, and Shadcn UI.

## How to Run This Project Locally

This is a React + Vite project, not a static HTML file. You cannot run it using "Live Preview". You must follow these steps in your terminal:

### 1. Install Dependencies
First, you need to install all the project's packages. Make sure you have Node.js installed.

```sh
npm install
```

### 2. Run the Development Server
This command will start the live development server.

```sh
npm run dev
```

### 3. Open in Browser
Your terminal will show you a local URL (usually `http://localhost:8080/`). Open this URL in your browser to see your website. It will auto-update as you save changes in your code editor.
